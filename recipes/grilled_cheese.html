        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>        
            It's all about the crust. Choose a hearty bread, butter it up, and shred your favorite cheddar for the best grilled cheese ever: crispy-crunchy on the outside, melty, cheddar middle, and the world's most impressive cheese pull.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>C5 tbsp. butter, softened, divided</li>
                <li>4 slices sourdough bread</li>
                <li>2 c. shredded cheddar</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Shred the cheese. Using a box grater, shred the cheddar cheese youâ€™ll be using for your sandwich.</li>
                <li>Butter the bread. Spread softened butter generously on the outer sides of each slice of bread.</li>
                <li>Grill. Place the bread, butter side down, on a pan over medium heat. Then top it with the shredded cheese, and finally the other slice of bread, butter side up. Allow it brown slightly before flipping, about 2-3 minutes on each side. Slice the grilled cheese sandwich and serve.</li>
            </ol>
